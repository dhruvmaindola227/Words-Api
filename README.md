# Words-Api

### I developed a game where you're shown 10 words randomly in a short duration and you have to remember them and then reselect them amongst 24 total words where the 10 previously shown words are mixed with them. 
### Earlier i kept 3 static lists of words but now i'm developing an open api which returns a random list of words and also stores the login information and previous high scores of users.
